# to run fully in docker:
# do NOT use the green arrows, it will throw an error because it can't accept user input!
# instead go to the terminal (in intellij) and run: docker-compose run app
# this will run it there and user input will work as normal :)

# to run with a local port:
# use the green arrow next to world-db
# then go to App.java and use the green arrow next to the main method
# this allows the database to stay up independently even after closing the app
